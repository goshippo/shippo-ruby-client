Shippo is a shipping API that connects you with [multiple shipping carriers](https://goshippo.com/carriers/) (such as USPS, UPS, DHL, Canada Post, Australia Post, UberRUSH and many others) through one interface.

Print a shipping label in 10 mins using our default USPS and DHL Express accounts. No need to register for a carrier account to get started.

You will need to [register for a Shippo account](https://goshippo.com/) to use the Shippo API. It's free to sign up, free to use the API. Only pay to print a live label, test labels are free.

## Installation

This library is distributed as a ruby gem, therefore you can install it via adding the following line to your `Gemfile`:

```
gem 'shippo'
```

If you prefer to use the latest version of the library, just point your Gemfile to our github repo:

```
gem 'shippo', git: 'https://github.com/goshippo/shippo-ruby-client'
```

Or you can install the gem using the `gem` command:

```bash
gem install shippo
```

## Usage

> NOTE: examples below use the gem `awesome_print` to dump formatted objects and hashes to STDOUT. To be able to use the examples verbatum, please ensure you have this gem installed, or run: `gem install awesome_print --no-rdoc --no-ri`

Below we demonstrate the most basic usage of the library:

```ruby
require 'shippo'

# Setup your API token
Shippo.api_token = 'aff988f77afa0fdfdfadf'  # not an actual valid token

# Setup query parameter hash
params   = {  async:          false,
              address_from:   {
                name:           'Mr Hippo',
                company:        'Shippo',
                street1:        '215 Clayton St.',
                street2:        '',
                city:           'San Francisco',
                state:          'CA',
                zip:            '94117',
                country:        'US',
                phone:          '+1 555 341 9393' },
              address_to:     {
                name:           'Mrs Hippo"',
                company:        'San Diego Zoo',
                street1:        '2920 Zoo Drive',
                city:           'San Diego',
                state:          'CA',
                zip:            '92101',
                country:        'US',
                phone:          '+1 555 341 9393',
                email:          'hippo@goshippo.com' },
              parcels:         {
                length:        5,
                width:         2,
                height:        5,
                distance_unit: :in,
                weight:        2,
                mass_unit:     :lb }
}

# Make our API call
@shipment = Shippo::Shipment.create(params)
@shipment.success?
# => true
@shipment.status
# => 'SUCCESS'
```

Let's take a quick look at what the `Shipment` object looks like:

```ruby
require 'awesome_print'
ap @shipment
# {
#   "carrier_accounts"    => [],
#   "address_from"        => {
#     "name"    => "Mr Hippo",
#     "company" => "Shippo",
#     "street1" => "215 Clayton St.",
#     "street2" => "",
#     "city"    => "San Francisco",
#     "state"   => "CA",
#     "zip"     => "94117",
#     "country" => "US",
#     "phone"   => "+1 555 341 9393"
#   },
#   "address_to"          => { ... },   # omitted for brevity
#   "address_return"      => { ... },
#   "parcels"             => [{
#     "length"        => 5,
#     "width"         => 2,
#     "height"        => 5,
#     "distance_unit" => in,
#     "weight"        => 2,
#     "mass_unit"     => lb,
#   }],
#   "shipment_date"       => "2016-07-06T20:33:02.211Z",
#   "customs_declaration" => nil,
#   "extra"               => {
#     "insurance"   => {
#       "amount"    => 10,
#       "currency"  => "USD",
#       "content"   => "",
#       "provider"  => "FEDEX"
#     },
#     "is_return"   => false,
#     "reference_1" => "",
#     "reference_2" => "",
#   },
#   "messages"            => [ ... ],
#   "rates"               => [ ... ]
# }
```

#### List Handling

In the case when the API returns a hash with one of the hash values being an array of entities, and if the corresponding key can be mapped into one of the existing API models, then each of the members of the array is coerced from a hash into an object of the model's type.

In the example below we are showing the result of such transformation where `rates` contains a list of fully constructed objects of type `Shippo::Rate` after being coerced from a hash.

```ruby
ap @shipment.rates.first
# =>
# { 
#   "shipment"            => "20f25e44b16b4051b6dd910cb66fd27b",
#   "attributes"          => [],
#   "amount"              => "8.51",
#   "currency"            => "USD",
#   "amount_local"        => "8.51",
#   "currency_local"      => "USD",
#   "provider"            => "FedEx",
#   "provider_image_75"   => "https://shippo-static.s3.amazonaws.com/providers/75/FedEx.png",
#   "provider_image_200"  => "https://shippo-static.s3.amazonaws.com/providers/200/FedEx.png",
#   "servicelevel"        => {
#     "name"  => "Ground",
#     "token" => "fedex_ground",
#     "terms" => ""
#   }
#   "days"                => 2,
#   "arrives_by"          => nil,
#   "duration_terms"      => "",
#   "messages"            => [],
#   "carrier_account"     => "4b1940bc69524163b669asd361842db",
#   "test"                => true
# }
@shipment.rates.first.owner
# ⤷ unittest@gmail.com
@shipment.rates.first.class
# ⤷ Shippo::Rate
```

#### List Endpoints

You can retrieve a list of objects for many endpoints (e.g. Transactions, Shipments). The API will return a paginated list of objects, usually sorted by creation date. Retrieving a list of your last Transactions can be done as follows, for instance:

```ruby
@transactions = Shippo::Transaction.all()
@transactions
# =>
# {
#   "count"     => 3055,
#   "next"      => "https://api.goshippo.com/v1/transactions/?page=2",
#   "previous"  => nil,
#   "results"   => [ ... list of Transaction objects ... ]
# }
```

#### Resource ID and Other Object Fields

Shippo API returns several generalized fields for each valid resource, that being with 'object_' – for example, `object_id`, `object_owner`, etc.  In this library we move these fields out of the main model, and into an instance of `Shippo::API::ApiObject`. However the fields can still be accessed on the main model via generated accessors.

Unfortunately Shippo API also returns `object_id`, which in Ruby has a special meaning: it's the pointer address of any object. Overwriting this field causes all sorts of issues.

For this reason we are mapping `object_id` to `resource_id`, as soon as the hash is passed in to initialize `ApiObject`. This way `object_id` continues to be used as a ruby internal field, and can be accessed as expected:

> In the example below, `object_id` does not refer to any API field, and is a ruby internal field.

```ruby
@shipment.object_id    # this is the Ruby object pointer
# ⤷ 70206221831520  
```
To access the `"object_id"` field retrieved with the API, see the following session that highlights many ways of accessing `object_id` field:

```ruby
@shipment.resource_id  # this is the API id (note: deprecated accessor)
# ⤷ 20f25e44b16b4051b6dd910cb66fd27b
@shipment.object.id    # which is actually just this
# ⤷ 20f25e44b16b4051b6dd910cb66fd27b
@shipment.id           # but it can also be accessed this way too
# ⤷ 20f25e44b16b4051b6dd910cb66fd27b
```

Finally, here is how we access the rest of the `object_` fields:

``` ruby
@shipment.object.owner    # this is whether 'object_owner' is stored
# ⤷ valued_customer@gmail.com
@shipment.object_owner    # deprecated accessor method
# ⤷ valued_customer@gmail.com
@shipment.owner           # forwarded alias to #object.owner
# ⤷ valued_customer@gmail.com
```

Here is the fully constructed `ApiObject` instance, attached to our `@shipment`:

```ruby
ap @shipment.object
# {
#   :created  => 2016-07-06 20:44:47 UTC,
#   :updated  => 2016-07-06 20:44:47 UTC,
#   :owner    => "valued_customer@gmail.com",
#   :id       => "20f25e44b16b4051b6dd910cb66fd27b"
# }
```

#### Validation

In general this gem does not currently perform validation, *except* in the cases when enumerations are used. The gem automatically converts a response containing keys matching one of the known categories (such as `Shippo::API::Category::Status` and it's value into one of the constants, such as `SUCCESS`.

### Using Provided Example File

Look at `bin/example` for more code sample.

You can actually run this file, but first you should set your API token in the environment:

```bash
export SHIPPO_TOKEN="<your token here>"
bin/example
```

NOTE: this environment variable is only used by the included `bin/example` script, and is not automatically used by the underlying client library.

## Gem Versioning Notes

Version 3 and up of this library works with Ruby 2.2 and later, and is not backwards compatible. __Version 1.0.4__ of this library is the last version supporting ruby 1.8 and 1.9.

__Warning:__ Version 3 brings potential backwards incompatibility issues. Please be prepared to update your usages (if necessary) when you migrate.

### If you are still using Ruby 1.8 or 1.9

If you are still using an older version of Ruby, please make sure to use the last 1.X version of this library, which is currently the [tag v1.0.4](https://github.com/goshippo/shippo-ruby-client/tree/v1.0.4).
